# 2. The Document model

## 2.1 Mental model

*Non-normative.*

Start with a fact about the formats Omnist reads. JSON, YAML, and TOML model an
object as a map from key to value, and express "many" by making that value a
list. XML does not. XML expresses "many" by repeating an element, and it lets
repeated elements interleave with other elements.

That difference is not cosmetic. Take this XML:

```xml
<order>
  <item>pen</item>
  <note>rush</note>
  <item>pad</item>
</order>
```

Read it into a map-of-arrays and you get `{"item": ["pen","pad"], "note": "rush"}`.
The note has moved. The original interleaving is gone and cannot be recovered.
Write it back out and you get a different document.

So Omnist does not use a map. A node is an **ordered list of labeled edges**:

```
[ (item, "pen"), (note, "rush"), (item, "pad") ]
```

Nothing has been reordered and nothing merged. The same three formats above read
into exactly this:

| Format | Text | Document |
|---|---|---|
| JSON | `{"item": ["pen","pad"], "note": "rush"}` | `[(item,"pen"), (item,"pad"), (note,"rush")]` |
| OML | `item: "pen"` / `note: "rush"` / `item: "pad"` | `[(item,"pen"), (note,"rush"), (item,"pad")]` |
| XML | the snippet above | `[(item,"pen"), (note,"rush"), (item,"pad")]` |

Two consequences follow, and they are the whole model.

**There is no array.** An array *is* a repeated label. `tags` appearing four
times is a four-element array of tags. Array-of-record and array-of-scalar are
the same thing, handled by the same mechanism, with no separate type to define.

**Object and array collapse into one thing.** A node is an edge list. The
object-versus-array distinction that every other data model carries does not
exist here, so no operation ever has to branch on it.

Order is preserved because a Document is a faithful record of what was read.
Order is never *checked*, because schemas count edges rather than sequencing
them. A reordered round trip stays valid.

## 2.2 Formal definition

A Document is a node.

```
scalar-value = string | integer | number | boolean | date | time | datetime
value        = scalar-value | null
edge         = (label, target)          ; label is a string
target       = value | node
node         = [ edge, edge, ... ]      ; ordered; labels MAY repeat
Document     = node | value             ; a bare value is a legal Document
```

### 2.2.1 Scalar kinds

Exactly seven scalar kinds exist:

| Kind | Domain |
|---|---|
| `string` | A sequence of Unicode code points |
| `integer` | An arbitrary-precision signed integer, subject to §2.4 |
| `number` | A real number, represented as IEEE 754 binary64 |
| `boolean` | `true` or `false` |
| `date` | A calendar date: year, month, day |
| `time` | A time of day, with optional sub-second precision and optional UTC offset |
| `datetime` | A date and a time of day, joined |

There is no `float` kind and no `decimal` kind. `number` covers non-integral
values. Implementations MUST NOT add scalar kinds; adding one changes the
Schema Algebra's subtyping lattice and therefore changes conformance results.

`null` is a value but not a kind. It has no scalar kind of its own and is
admitted only where a schema permits it (§3).

### 2.2.2 Labels

A label is a string. Any Unicode string is a legal label. Two edges in the same
node MAY carry the same label; nothing in the Document model constrains
uniqueness, ordering, or the relationship between repeated labels.

### 2.2.3 Nesting

A target is either a value or a node. Nothing else. In particular there is no
bare nested list: a target cannot be a list of unlabeled items, because an
unlabeled item has no edge to occupy. An input containing one (JSON
`[[1,2],[3,4]]`, for instance) MUST be rejected at read time, not silently
flattened. See [chapter 7](07-codecs-and-deserialization.md).

---

## 2.3 Structural invariants

A conformant implementation MUST maintain all of the following for every
Document it constructs, reads, or hands back.

**D-1. Edge order is preserved.** The order of edges within a node MUST be the
order they appeared in the source, for every reader. Implementations MUST NOT
sort, group, or stabilize edge order at read time.

**D-2. Repeated labels are not merged.** Two edges with the same label remain
two edges. An implementation MUST NOT collapse them into a single edge carrying
a list.

**D-3. Order is never a schema constraint.** No operation in
[chapter 6](06-schema-algebra.md) and no validation rule in §3 may consult edge
order. A permutation of a node's edges MUST produce identical validation and
identical algebra results.

**D-4. A target is a value or a node.** No third case exists. Implementations
MUST NOT introduce a list-valued target as an internal representation that can
escape into user-visible Documents.

**D-5. Scalar identity is by kind and value.** Two scalars are equal when their
kinds and values are equal. An `integer` and a `number` of the same magnitude
are distinct scalars in the Document model, even though `integer` is a subtype
of `number` in the Schema model (§6).

> D-3 is the invariant most likely to be violated by accident, usually by an
> implementation that validates a node by zipping it against a field list. Zip
> against counts, not positions.

## 2.4 Resource caps

A Document is built from untrusted input. Three limits bound the work an
implementation will do before refusing. All three are hard, normative constants.
They are not defaults, they are not tiered, and implementations MUST NOT make
them configurable at a value above the constant.

| Limit | Value | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| Maximum nesting depth | 200 | Levels of node nesting, counted from the Document root |
| Maximum node count | 1 000 000 | Nodes materialized while building one Document |
| Maximum integer digits | 4300 | Decimal digits in an `integer` literal, sign excluded |

Exceeding any of the three MUST be reported as an error, not truncated,
clamped, or silently accepted.

**On the digit cap.** 4300 matches CPython's own default for
`sys.set_int_max_str_digits`. Conversion between an arbitrarily long digit
string and a big integer is superlinear, so an unbounded literal is a
denial-of-service vector. This is a safety bound, not a modeling statement: the
`integer` kind itself is arbitrary-precision.

**On the node cap.** The node count bounds total materialized nodes, not depth.
It exists because a shallow document can still be enormous — a million sibling
edges is depth 1.

**On depth.** The depth cap and the OML parser's nesting cap are the same
number, deliberately. A document that parses MUST NOT then fail to build.

**Error reporting.** These three limits produce errors in the
`document.limit.*` family; the canonical codes are defined in
[chapter 8](08-conformance-and-errors.md). Note that chapter 8's code scheme is
new normative material and no implementation emits it yet.
